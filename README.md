# DreamControl
**Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and Studio Monitor Control Surface**

This is an open-source project for my 'dream' DAW controller. There are several controllers and plugins on the market that do similar things - I wanted everything neatly integrated, so I came up with this design. The designs and code are free for personal use (not for commercial use).

The system consists of a hardware **USB control surface** built using the excellent Midibox platform, and a **VST plugin** that sits on your DAW master bus.

Currently, the system is designed for my DAW of choice which is **Cubase**, and the plugin can be used with it's Control Room feature, but it could easily be adapted to support Logic, Bitwig, or other DAWs.
## Features
 - Switch between your mix and 6 different other sources (4 + 2 'external').
