# DreamControl
**Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and Studio Monitor Control Surface**

This is an open-source project for my 'dream' DAW controller. There are several controllers and plugins on the market that do similar things - I wanted everything neatly integrated, so I came up with this design. It is free for personal use only, not 

The system consists of a **hardware USB controller** built using the excellent Midibox platform, and a **VST plugin** that sits on your DAW master bus.

Currently, the system is designed for my DAW of choice which is **Cubase**, but it could easily be adapted to support Logic, Bitwig, or other DAWs.
